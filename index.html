                    <h2>What is a School App </h2>
                    <p>A school app is a category of communication programs designed for schools to establish connectivity with parents and students and drive engagement. 

                        The primary role of a school app is to act as a go-to channel to facilitate all types of school communication, be it school updates, announcements, circulars, parent-teacher meetings or any other kind of communication. Usually, the need for a school app arises when schools push for a communication system that helps them overcome the barriers of ineffective and costly methods of communication like SMS and Email and adopt a practical and privacy-oriented solution that allows them to unify all their communication activities. 
                        
                        The school apps rose to popularity with the revolutions in mobile applications and the growing need for modern parents to have a more connected schools communication experience to stay close with their children. While the implementation of school apps started as a result to address these rising demands and to establish a communication infrastructure that is secure, effective, and fast for everyone involved while having control over all the communication activities and engagement in the school.

                  <div class="schoolapp_para">
                      <p>What makes School apps unique from other traditional communication methods like SMS and email is their dedicated communication infrastructure, social media-inspired chat interface, and increased security and advanced parent engagement features. 

                        According to a recent study by Gallup, parents who engage fully with their child's school are 94% more likely to recommend the school to their friends or family members. So the adoption of school communication apps can also be seen as a way for schools to improve their communication ecosystem and position themself better to reach more parents and attract new students year over year.
